DepthDataShader.shader and postproc.cs are both for getting depth information in unity. Both scripts are the result of utilizing multiple tutorials so the naming of certain objects can be weird.
Essentially, DepthDataShader.shader allows a shader called postproc to be available. Apply that shader to a materical and call it postprocessing. Then, attach postproc to a camera and select postprocessing as your Postprocess Material.
