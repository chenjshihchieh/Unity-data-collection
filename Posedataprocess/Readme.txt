1. I added my code based on the existing scripts "demo.cs" and "smoothFollows.cs" in directory "..Huge Mocap Library\demo\scripts"
2. added two new class "CameraPointsData.cs"(use to pack screen points to json),  HumanPoseData.cs(used to pack pose data to json)
3. In the "update()" method where I saved the Json file, I hard coded the "filename". Please adjust to make them align with your style.
4. I didn't do the "coroutine", don't have time to do that. I think it's easy to do it in your part coz you already  have that.
